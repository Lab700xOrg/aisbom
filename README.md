# AIsbom: The Supply Chain for Artificial Intelligence

[![PyPI version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/aisbom-cli.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/aisbom-cli/)
![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Apache%202.0-blue)
![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.11%2B-blue)
![Compliance](https://img.shields.io/badge/standard-CycloneDX-green)

**AIsbom** is a specialized security and compliance scanner for Machine Learning artifacts.
- **SPDX 2.3**: Standard SBOM format for industry compliance.
- **CycloneDX**: Supported (Default output format).

Install via **Pip** or download our **standalone, air-gapped binary** for USB/offline audits.

Unlike generic SBOM tools that only parse `requirements.txt`, AIsbom performs **Deep Binary Introspection** on model files (`.pt`, `.pkl`, `.safetensors`, `.gguf`) to detect malware risks and legal license violations hidden inside the serialized weights.

## Quick Start

### 1. Installation
Install directly from PyPI. No cloning required.

```bash
pip install aisbom-cli
```
*Note: The package name is `aisbom-cli`, but the command you run is `aisbom`.*

### 1a. Standalone Binary (Air-Gapped)
For environments where installing Python is not possible, download the single-file executable from our [Releases page](https://github.com/Lab700xOrg/aisbom/releases/latest).

> **📚 Guide:** [How to Audit Air-Gapped / Offline Systems](docs/air-gapped-guide.md)

**Available Binaries:**
*   `aisbom-linux-amd64` (Linux x86_64)
*   `aisbom-macos-amd64` (macOS Intel)
*   `aisbom-macos-arm64` (macOS Silicon M1/M2/M3)

#### Installation & Troubleshooting (macOS)
Due to Apple's strict security policies for unsigned binaries, you must explicitly allow the application to run.

```bash
# 1. Make the binary executable
chmod +x aisbom-macos-*

# 2. Remove the "Quarantine" attribute (Fixes "Unidentified Developer" error)
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine aisbom-macos-*

# 3. Run it
./aisbom-macos-arm64 --help
```

*Why is `xattr` needed?*
macOS tags downloaded files with a "quarantine" attribute. Since our open-source binary is not code-signed with an Apple Developer ID, Gatekeeper will block it by default. The `xattr -d` command removes this tag, allowing the binary to execute on your machine.
*   **Zero Dependencies**: Everything is bundled.
*   **Portable**: Runs on bare metal servers.

### 2. Run a Local Scan
Point it at any directory containing your ML project. It scans recursively for requirements files AND binary model artifacts.

```bash
aisbom scan ./my-project-folder
```

### 3. The Output
You will see a combined Security & Legal risk assessment in your terminal:

```text

└─────────────────────┴─────────────┴──────────────────────┴─────────────────────────────┘
```

A compliant `sbom.json` (CycloneDX v1.6) including SHA256 hashes and license data will be generated in your current directory.

### 4. Share Your SBOM (New!)
You can instantly generate a secure, hosted, and shareable link for your SBOM by appending the `--share` flag to your scan.

```bash
aisbom scan ./my-project-folder --share
```
*Note: Your SBOM will be uploaded to aisbom.io and available publicly to anyone with the link for 30 days. You will be prompted for confirmation unless you also pass `--share-yes`.*

---

## Advanced Usage

### Remote Scanning (Hugging Face)
Scan models directly on Hugging Face **without downloading** terabytes of weights. We use HTTP Range requests to inspect headers over the wire.

```bash
aisbom scan hf://google-bert/bert-base-uncased
```
*   **Speed:** Scans in seconds, not minutes.
*   **Storage:** Zero disk usage.
*   **Security:** Verify "SafeTensors" compliance before you even `git clone`.

### Config Drift Detection
Detect "Silent Regressions" in your AI Supply Chain. The `diff` command compares your current SBOM against a known baseline JSON.

```bash
aisbom diff baseline_sbom.json new_sbom.json
```

**Drift Analysis Output:**

```text
┏━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┓
┃ Component     ┃ Type     ┃ Change  ┃ Security Risk  ┃ Legal Risk      ┃ Details        ┃
┡━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┩
│ drift-risk.pt │ Modified │ DRIFT   │ LOW ->         │ -               │                │
│               │          │         │ CRITICAL       │                 │                │
│ drift-license │ Modified │ DRIFT   │ -              │ UNKNOWN ->      │ Lic: MIT ->    │
│               │          │         │                │ LEGAL RISK      │ CC-BY-NC       │
│ drift-hash.pt │ Modified │ DRIFT   │ INTEGRITY FAIL │ -               │ Hash: ...      │
└───────────────┴──────────┴─────────┴────────────────┴─────────────────┴────────────────┘
```

It enforces Quality Gates by exiting with **code 1** if:
*   A new **CRITICAL** risk is introduced.
*   A Component's risk level escalates (e.g., LOW -> CRITICAL).
*   **Hash Drift**: A verified file has been tampered with (Marked as INTEGRITY FAIL).

### Strict Mode (Allowlisting)
For high-security environments, switch from "Blocklisting" (looking for malware) to "Allowlisting" (blocking everything unknown).

```bash
aisbom scan model.pkl --strict
```

This will report **any** import that is not in the safe-list.
**Allowed Libraries**: `torch` (and submodules), `numpy`, `collections`, `typing`, `datetime`, `re`, `pathlib`, `copy`, `functools`, `dataclasses`, `uuid`.
**Allowed Builtins**: `dict`, `list`, `set`, `tuple`, `int`, `float`, `str`, `bytes`, etc., etc.).
*   Flags *any* unknown global import as `CRITICAL`.

### Migration Readiness (PyTorch weights_only=True)
Prepare your models for the upcoming PyTorch security defaults. PyTorch 2.6+ will default to `weights_only=True`, which breaks many legacy models.

```bash
aisbom scan model.pt --lint
```

The `--lint` flag activates the Migration Linter, which statically simulates the unpickling stack to predict runtime failures without executing code.

### Strategy: Defense in Depth

AIsbom advocates for a two-layer security approach:

1.  **Layer 1 (Pre-Execution):** Use `aisbom scan --lint` to statically analyze the file structure. This catches 99% of obvious malware and incompatible globals without ever loading the file.
2.  **Layer 2 (Runtime Isolation):** If you *must* load a model that uses `REDUCE` or unsafe globals (common in legacy files), do not run it on bare metal.
    *   **Recommendation:** Use [Sandboxed Execution](docs/sandboxed-execution.md) (e.g., `uvx` + `amazing-sandbox`) to contain any potential RCE.

> [!TIP]
> **Why both?** Static analysis is fast but can be tricked by complex obfuscation. Runtime sandboxing is secure but slow. Together, they provide speed and safety.

**It detects:**
*   **Custom Class Imports**: Objects that are not in the PyTorch default allowlist.
*   **Unsafe Globals**: Usage of `posix.system` or other unsafe modules.

**Output:**

## CI/CD Integration

Add AIsbom to your GitHub Actions pipeline.
**Behavior:** The scanner returns `exit code 1` if Critical risks are found, automatically blocking the build/merge.

```yaml
name: AI Security Scan
on: [pull_request]

jobs:
  aisbom-scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Scan AI Models
        uses: Lab700xOrg/aisbom@v0
        with:
          directory: '.'
```

## Visualize the Report
Don't like reading JSON? You can visualize your security posture using our **offline** viewer.

1.  Run the scan to generate `sbom.json`.
2.  Go to [aisbom.io/viewer.html](https://aisbom.io/viewer.html).
3.  Drag and drop your JSON file.
4.  Get an instant dashboard of risks, license issues, and compliance stats.

*Note: The viewer is client-side only. Your SBOM data never leaves your browser.*

## Why AIsbom?

AI models are not just text files; they are executable programs and IP assets.

*   **The Security Risk:** PyTorch (`.pt`) files are Zip archives containing Pickle bytecode. A malicious model can execute arbitrary code (RCE) instantly when loaded.
*   **The Legal Risk:** A developer might download a "Non-Commercial" model (CC-BY-NC) and deploy it to production. Since the license is hidden inside the binary header, standard tools miss it.
*   **The Solution:** **We look inside.** We decompile bytecode and parse internal metadata headers without loading the heavy weights into RAM.

## Telemetry & Privacy

AIsbom collects a small amount of anonymous usage telemetry — what model formats people scan, how often critical findings appear, whether scans run in CI — to help us prioritize what to build. We treat this with the same care we expect from any security tool. Read what we collect, then opt out if you'd rather not participate.

### What's collected

Per `aisbom scan`: `target_type` (the **bucket**: `local` / `huggingface` / `http` / `https` — never the actual path or URL), `model_format` (the file-type bucket), `risk_level_max`, `scan_duration_ms`, `file_count`, `parse_error_count`, `strict_mode`. A `cli_scan_critical_found` event with a count is added when at least one CRITICAL is found.

If you explicitly use `--share`: the generated `sbom.json` document is uploaded to our servers and retained for 30 days to generate the shareable viewer link. A `cli_share_created` event is fired tracking whether `has_share_yes=true|false`.

Per `aisbom diff`: a `cli_diff` event with `has_drift=true|false`.

On unhandled exceptions: a `cli_error` event records the exception class name only (e.g. `JSONDecodeError`) — never the message, traceback, or any file content.

Each event carries an anonymous `user_id` — a SHA-256 of your machine's MAC address plus an app salt, truncated to 16 hex chars. Stored in `~/.aisbom/config.json`. Lets us see returning users without identifying anyone.

### What's never collected

File paths, directory contents, model names, target URLs, file hashes from your SBOMs, exception messages, tracebacks, or anything that could identify you, your project, or your organization.

### Opt out

Set `AISBOM_NO_TELEMETRY=1`. This wins over every other setting — telemetry will not fire and `~/.aisbom/config.json` will not be written.

```bash
# Permanent
export AISBOM_NO_TELEMETRY=1

# Single invocation
AISBOM_NO_TELEMETRY=1 aisbom scan ./my-project
```

### Where the data goes

Events POST to `https://api.aisbom.io/v1/telemetry` (a Cloudflare Worker we operate), which sanitizes the payload and forwards to Google Analytics 4 on the dedicated `cli.aisbom.io` data stream. We don't share, sell, or use this data for ad targeting.

### CI environments

When `CI=true` or `GITHUB_ACTIONS=true`, the `cli_install_first_seen` event is suppressed (containers are ephemeral and would otherwise spam the metric). Other events still fire, tagged `is_ci=true`.

### Status

As of **0.9.1**, telemetry is **on by default**. `AISBOM_NO_TELEMETRY=1` is the single opt-out lever and is honored on every code path. The previous `AISBOM_TELEMETRY_V2=1` opt-in flag was retired once the rollout soak completed — setting it today is a harmless no-op.

## How to Verify (The "Trust Factor")

Security tools require trust. **We do not distribute malicious binaries.**

However, AIsbom includes a built-in generator so you can create safe "mock artifacts" to verify the scanner works.

**1. Install:**
```bash
pip install aisbom-cli
```

**2. Generate Test Artifacts:**
Run this command to create a mock "Pickle Bomb" and a "Restricted License" model in your current folder.
```bash
aisbom generate-test-artifacts
```
*Result: Files named `mock_malware.pt`, `mock_restricted.safetensors`, `mock_restricted.gguf`, and `mock_broken.pt` are created.*

**3. Scan them:**
```bash
aisbom scan .
```
*Result: You will see `mock_malware.pt` flagged as **CRITICAL**, legal risks flagged, and if you run with `--lint`, `mock_broken.pt` will appear in the Migration Readiness table.*

## Security Logic Details
AIsbom uses a static analysis engine to disassemble Python Pickle opcodes. It looks for specific `GLOBAL` and `STACK_GLOBAL` instructions that reference dangerous modules:
*   `os` / `posix` (System calls)
*   `subprocess` (Shell execution)
*   `builtins.eval` / `exec` (Dynamic code execution)
*   `socket` (Network reverse shells)
